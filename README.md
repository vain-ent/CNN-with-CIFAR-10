# CNN-with-CIFAR-10
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 data set into 10 object classes. The model is optimized for high accuracy (~90%), efficiency, and readability with precise evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy/loss plots, and classification report.

The notebook contains:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- CNN model architecture
- Training and evaluation
- Visualization of results (accuracy, loss, and predictions)

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
