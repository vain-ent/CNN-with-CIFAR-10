# CNN-with-CIFAR-10
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 data set into 10 object classes. The model is optimized for high accuracy (~90%), efficiency, and readability with precise evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy/loss plots, and classification report.
